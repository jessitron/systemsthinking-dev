After twenty years in software development, Jess believes that we are doing more than building.
More than crafting.
We are forming the systems that make up reality. Much of the world we live in, the world we see
and the world we act in, is made of software these days.

What we develop matters. And more: the way we develop it matters. It matters for how it changes us.
Software lets us form complex systems faster, and adapt them faster, than any
human-made material of the past. This means we can learn how to make better systems.

For this, we have to learn how to see those systems. Then we have to practice changing them
in small ways, and consciously looking at what happens.
