# Books we like

This is a growing list of books that have helped us learn about systems.

The book that will transform your thinking depends on where you are, more than which book you read. Pick a few that speak to you.

## Donella Meadows

### Thinking in Systems: A Primer

If you don't really believe systems thinking is necessary, then start here.

## Jerry Weinberg

### Quality Software Management, Volume 1: Systems Thinking

Diagrams of effect! Software development process patterns! This is about how nonlinear effects and feedback loops spoil attempts at controlling management.
We need to steer instead.

### Secrets of Consulting

Short. Witty. Brilliant. Full of the kind of statement that seems obvious after you absorb it, but wasn't before.

Read this if you have eyes and enough industry experience to be exasperated.

## Alicia Juarrero

### Dynamics in Action

If you want to get deep into how human behavior happens, with detailed philosophy and some math, this is an important book. It's significant in the modern
conversation in philosophy.

This book is not about dynamics. (I thought at first it'd be about physics.) This is a book about action -- deliberate human action.
(It's philosophy!)

IMO this book answers the question of "do we have free will?" Spoiler: it's "we have influence, not control, over what we do."

This is a tough read, because it's academic. There's a lot of review of existing work, starting with Aristotle. (That part was interesting,
because it was mostly new to me.) It's also really expensive on Amazon. But the author provides [a pdf on her website](https://aliciajuarrerodotcom1.wordpress.com/dynamics-in-action-2/)!

Favorite chapter: Chapter 10, Dynamical Constraints as Landscapes: Meaning and Behavior as Topology.
