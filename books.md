# Books we like

This is a growing list of books that have helped us learn about systems.

The book that will transform your thinking depends on where you are, more than which book you read. Pick a few that speak to you.

## Donella Meadows

### Thinking in Systems: A Primer (2008)

If you don't really believe systems thinking is necessary, then start here.

## Jerry Weinberg

### Quality Software Management, Volume 1: Systems Thinking (1991)

Diagrams of effect! Software development process patterns! This is about how nonlinear effects and feedback loops spoil attempts at controlling management.
We need to steer instead.

### Secrets of Consulting 1986

Short. Witty. Brilliant. Full of the kind of statement that seems obvious after you absorb it, but wasn't before.

Read this if you have eyes and enough industry experience to be exasperated.

## Alicia Juarrero

### Dynamics in Action (2002)

If you want to get deep into how human behavior happens, with detailed philosophy and some math, this is an important book. It's significant in the modern
conversation in philosophy.

This book is not about dynamics. (I thought at first it'd be about physics.) This is a book about action -- deliberate human action.
(It's philosophy!)

IMO this book answers the question of "do we have free will?" Spoiler: it's "we have influence, not control, over what we do."

This is a tough read, because it's academic. There's a lot of review of existing work, starting with Aristotle. (That part was interesting,
because it was mostly new to me.) It's also really expensive on Amazon at the moment. But the author provides [a pdf on her website](https://aliciajuarrerodotcom1.wordpress.com/dynamics-in-action-2/)!

Favorite chapter: Chapter 10, Dynamical Constraints as Landscapes: Meaning and Behavior as Topology.

## Michael Turvey

Here's a [cool 15m video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLR7ZTSel9M) by Turvey on perception and tensegrity.

### Lectures on Perception (2018)

Read this one if you want to reconsider how we see and perceive. 

This book is about vision (as in, eyes) in ecological psychology. It gave me my favorite definition of what constitutes a system: parts, interactions between parts, and interactions between parts and pieces of the environment. The best stuff is in Lecture 1, and the first three lectures are free!
I highly recommend the [free Kindle sample](https://smile.amazon.com/Lectures-Perception-Perspective-Michael-Turvey-ebook-dp-B07K4SCKR1/dp/B07K4SCKR1/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1604875159). The book itself is expensive.

## Byung-chul Han

### Shanzhai: Deconstruction in Chinese (2017)

Read this adorable little volume if you are tired of arguing over "was it invented or discovered" or "who came up with this first" 
and ready to see creation as a conversation.

It describes the Chinese concepts of "original" and "creative." They're much less hero-centric than Western ideas. It's refreshing.
